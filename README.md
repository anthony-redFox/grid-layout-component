# Grid-Layout-Component

[![Node.js CI](https://github.com/anthony-redFox/grid-layout-component/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/anthony-redFox/grid-layout-component/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)
[![npm package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/grid-layout-component.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grid-layout-component)
[![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/grid-layout-component.svg?maxAge=2592000)]()

It is fork of [React-Grid-Layout](https://react-grid-layout.github.io/react-grid-layout/) and was reworked on web compoenent. Grid Layout Component is a grid layout system much like [Packery](http://packery.metafizzy.co/) or
[Gridster](http://dsmorse.github.io/gridster.js/).

Unlike those systems, it is responsive and supports breakpoints. Breakpoint layouts can be provided by the user
or autogenerated.

No deps or any frameworks or libraries.

## Installation

Install the Grid Layout Component [package](https://www.npmjs.org/package/react-grid-layout) package using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install react-grid-layout
```

## Usage

Use ReactGridLayout like any other component. The following example below will
produce a grid with three items where:

- users will not be able to drag or resize item `a`
- item `b` will be restricted to a minimum width of 2 grid blocks and a maximum width of 4 grid blocks
- users will be able to freely drag and resize item `c`

```js
import GridLayout from "react-grid-layout";

class MyFirstGrid extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // layout is an array of objects, see the demo for more complete usage
    const layout = [
      { i: "a", x: 0, y: 0, w: 1, h: 2, static: true },
      { i: "b", x: 1, y: 0, w: 3, h: 2, minW: 2, maxW: 4 },
      { i: "c", x: 4, y: 0, w: 1, h: 2 }
    ];
    return (
      <GridLayout
        className="layout"
        layout={layout}
        cols={12}
        rowHeight={30}
        width={1200}
      >
        <div key="a">a</div>
        <div key="b">b</div>
        <div key="c">c</div>
      </GridLayout>
    );
  }
}
```

You may also choose to set layout properties directly on the children:

```js
import GridLayout from "react-grid-layout";

class MyFirstGrid extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <GridLayout className="layout" cols={12} rowHeight={30} width={1200}>
        <div key="a" data-grid={{ x: 0, y: 0, w: 1, h: 2, static: true }}>
          a
        </div>
        <div key="b" data-grid={{ x: 1, y: 0, w: 3, h: 2, minW: 2, maxW: 4 }}>
          b
        </div>
        <div key="c" data-grid={{ x: 4, y: 0, w: 1, h: 2 }}>
          c
        </div>
      </GridLayout>
    );
  }
}
```

### Usage without Browserify/Webpack

A module usable in a `<script>` tag is included [here](/dist/react-grid-layout.min.js). It uses a UMD shim and
excludes `React`, so it must be otherwise available in your application, either via RequireJS or on `window.React`.

### Responsive Usage

To make RGL responsive, use the `<ResponsiveReactGridLayout>` element:

```js
import { Responsive as ResponsiveGridLayout } from "react-grid-layout";

class MyResponsiveGrid extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // {lg: layout1, md: layout2, ...}
    const layouts = getLayoutsFromSomewhere();
    return (
      <ResponsiveGridLayout
        className="layout"
        layouts={layouts}
        breakpoints={{ lg: 1200, md: 996, sm: 768, xs: 480, xxs: 0 }}
        cols={{ lg: 12, md: 10, sm: 6, xs: 4, xxs: 2 }}
      >
        <div key="1">1</div>
        <div key="2">2</div>
        <div key="3">3</div>
      </ResponsiveGridLayout>
    );
  }
}
```

When in responsive mode, you should supply at least one breakpoint via the `layouts` property.

When using `layouts`, it is best to supply as many breakpoints as possible, especially the largest one.
If the largest is provided, RGL will attempt to interpolate the rest.

You will also need to provide a `width`, when using `<ResponsiveReactGridLayout>` it is suggested you use the HOC
`WidthProvider` as per the instructions below.

It is possible to supply default mappings via the `data-grid` property on individual
items, so that they would be taken into account within layout interpolation.

### Providing Grid Width

Both `<ResponsiveReactGridLayout>` and `<ReactGridLayout>` take `width` to calculate
positions on drag events. In simple cases a HOC `WidthProvider` can be used to automatically determine
width upon initialization and window resize events.

```js
import { Responsive, WidthProvider } from "react-grid-layout";

const ResponsiveGridLayout = WidthProvider(Responsive);

class MyResponsiveGrid extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // {lg: layout1, md: layout2, ...}
    var layouts = getLayoutsFromSomewhere();
    return (
      <ResponsiveGridLayout
        className="layout"
        layouts={layouts}
        breakpoints={{ lg: 1200, md: 996, sm: 768, xs: 480, xxs: 0 }}
        cols={{ lg: 12, md: 10, sm: 6, xs: 4, xxs: 2 }}
      >
        <div key="1">1</div>
        <div key="2">2</div>
        <div key="3">3</div>
      </ResponsiveGridLayout>
    );
  }
}
```

This allows you to easily replace `WidthProvider` with your own Provider HOC if you need more sophisticated logic.

`WidthProvider` accepts a single prop, `measureBeforeMount`. If `true`, `WidthProvider` will measure the
container's width before mounting children. Use this if you'd like to completely eliminate any resizing animation
on application/component mount.

Have a more complicated layout? `WidthProvider` [is very simple](/lib/components/WidthProvider.jsx) and only
listens to window `'resize'` events. If you need more power and flexibility, try the
[SizeMe React HOC](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/react-sizeme) as an alternative to WidthProvider.

### Grid Layout Props

RGL supports the following properties (see the source for the final word on this):

```js
//
// Basic props
//

// If true, the container height swells and contracts to fit contents.
// It will be set automaticaly in false when height or overflow is set.
autoSize: ?boolean = true,

// Number of columns in this layout.
cols: ?number = 12,

// Compaction type.
compactType: ?('vertical' | 'horizontal') = 'vertical';

// Layout is an array of object with the format:
// {x: number, y: number, w: number, h: number}
// The index into the layout must match the key used on each item component.
// If you choose to use custom keys, you can specify that key in the layout
// array objects like so:
// {i: string, x: number, y: number, w: number, h: number}
layout: ?array = null, // If not provided, use data-grid props on children

// Margin between items [x, y] in px.
margin: ?[number, number] = [10, 10],

// Padding inside the container [x, y] in px
containerPadding: ?[number, number] = margin,

// Rows have a static height, but you can change this based on breakpoints
// if you like.
rowHeight: ?number = 150,

//
// Flags
//
drag: ?boolean = true,
resizable: ?boolean = true,
// If parent DOM node of ResponsiveReactGridLayout or ReactGridLayout has "transform: scale(n)" css property,
// we should set scale coefficient to avoid render artefacts while dragging.
transformScale: ?number = 1,

// If true, grid can be placed one over the other.
// If set, implies `preventCollision`.
allowOverlap: ?boolean = false,

// If true, grid items won't change position when being
// dragged over. If `allowOverlap` is still false,
// this simply won't allow one to drop on an existing object.
preventCollision: ?boolean = false,

//
// Callbacks
//

// Callback so you can save the layout.
// Calls back with (currentLayout) after every drag or resize stop.
onLayoutChange: (layout: Layout) => void,

//
// All callbacks below have signature (layout, oldItem, newItem, placeholder, e, element).
// 'start' and 'stop' callbacks pass `undefined` for 'placeholder'.
//
type ItemCallback = (layout: Layout, oldItem: LayoutItem, newItem: LayoutItem,
                     placeholder: LayoutItem, e: MouseEvent, element: HTMLElement) => void,

// Calls when drag starts.
onDragStart: ItemCallback,
// Calls on each drag movement.
onDrag: ItemCallback,
// Calls when drag is complete.
onDragStop: ItemCallback,
// Calls when resize starts.
onResizeStart: ItemCallback,
// Calls when resize movement happens.
onResize: ItemCallback,
// Calls when resize is complete.
onResizeStop: ItemCallback,

//
// Dropover functionality
//

// Calls when an element has been dropped into the grid from outside.
onDrop: (layout: Layout, item: ?LayoutItem, e: Event) => void,
// Calls when an element is being dragged over the grid from outside as above.
// This callback should return an object to dynamically change the droppingItem size
// Return false to short-circuit the dragover
onDropDragOver: (e: DragOverEvent) => ?({|w?: number, h?: number|} | false),

// Ref for getting a reference for the grid's wrapping div.
// You can use this instead of a regular ref and the deprecated `ReactDOM.findDOMNode()`` function.
innerRef: ?React.Ref<"div">,
```

### Responsive Grid Layout Props

The responsive grid layout can be used instead. It supports all of the props above, excepting `layout`.
The new properties and changes are:

```js
// {name: pxVal}, e.g. {lg: 1200, md: 996, sm: 768, xs: 480}
// Breakpoint names are arbitrary but must match in the cols and layouts objects.
breakpoints: ?Object = {lg: 1200, md: 996, sm: 768, xs: 480, xxs: 0},

// # of cols. This is a breakpoint -> cols map, e.g. {lg: 12, md: 10, ...}
cols: ?Object = {lg: 12, md: 10, sm: 6, xs: 4, xxs: 2},


// margin (in pixels). Can be specified either as horizontal and vertical margin, e.g. `[10, 10]` or as a breakpoint -> margin map, e.g. `{lg: [10, 10], md: [10, 10], ...}.
margin: [number, number] | {[breakpoint: $Keys<breakpoints>]: [number, number]},


// containerPadding (in pixels). Can be specified either as horizontal and vertical padding, e.g. `[10, 10]` or as a breakpoint -> containerPadding map, e.g. `{lg: [10, 10], md: [10, 10], ...}.
containerPadding: [number, number] | {[breakpoint: $Keys<breakpoints>]: [number, number]},


// layouts is an object mapping breakpoints to layouts.
// e.g. {lg: Layout, md: Layout, ...}
layouts: {[key: $Keys<breakpoints>]: Layout},

//
// Callbacks
//

// Calls back with breakpoint and new # cols
onBreakpointChange: (newBreakpoint: string, newCols: number) => void,

// Callback so you can save the layout.
// AllLayouts are keyed by breakpoint.
onLayoutChange: (currentLayout: Layout, allLayouts: {[key: $Keys<breakpoints>]: Layout}) => void,

// Callback when the width changes, so you can modify the layout as needed.
onWidthChange: (containerWidth: number, margin: [number, number], cols: number, containerPadding: [number, number]) => void;

```

### Grid Item Props

RGL supports the following properties on grid items or layout items. When initializing a grid,
build a layout array (as in the first example above), or attach this object as the `data-grid` property
to each of your child elements (as in the second example).

Note that if a grid item is provided but incomplete (missing one of `x, y, w, or h`), an error
will be thrown so you can correct your layout.

If no properties are provided for a grid item, one will be generated with a width and height of `1`.

You can set minimums and maximums for each dimension. This is for resizing; it of course has no effect if resizing
is disabled. Errors will be thrown if your mins and maxes overlap incorrectly, or your initial dimensions
are out of range.

Any `<GridItem>` properties defined directly will take precedence over globally-set options. For
example, if the layout has the property `drag: false`, but the grid item has the prop `drag: true`, the item
will be draggable, even if the item is marked `static: true`.

```js
{

  // A string corresponding to the component key
  i: string,

  // These are all in grid units, not pixels
  x: number,
  y: number,
  w: number,
  h: number,
  minW: ?number = 0,
  maxW: ?number = Infinity,
  minH: ?number = 0,
  maxH: ?number = Infinity,

  // If true, equal to `drag: false, resizable: false`.
  static: ?boolean = false,
  // If false, will not be draggable. Overrides `static`.
  drag: ?boolean = true,
  // If false, will not be resizable. Overrides `static`.
  resizable: ?boolean = true,
  // By default, a handle is only shown on the bottom-right (southeast) corner.
  // Note that resizing from the top or left is generally not intuitive.
  resizeHandles?: ?Array<'s' | 'w' | 'e' | 'n' | 'sw' | 'nw' | 'se' | 'ne'> = ['se']
  // If true and draggable, item will be moved only within grid.
  bounded: ?boolean = false
}
```

### Performance

`<ReactGridLayout>` has [an optimized `shouldComponentUpdate` implementation](lib/ReactGridLayout.jsx), but it relies on the user memoizing the `children` array:

```js
// lib/ReactGridLayout.jsx
// ...
shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps: Props, nextState: State) {
  return (
    // NOTE: this is almost always unequal. Therefore the only way to get better performance
    // from SCU is if the user intentionally memoizes children. If they do, and they can
    // handle changes properly, performance will increase.
    this.props.children !== nextProps.children ||
    !fastRGLPropsEqual(this.props, nextProps, isEqual) ||
    !isEqual(this.state.activeDrag, nextState.activeDrag)
  );
}
// ...
```

If you memoize your children, you can take advantage of this, and reap faster rerenders. For example:

```js
function MyGrid(props) {
  const children = React.useMemo(() => {
    return new Array(props.count).fill(undefined).map((val, idx) => {
      return <div key={idx} data-grid={{ x: idx, y: 1, w: 1, h: 1 }} />;
    });
  }, [props.count]);
  return <ReactGridLayout cols={12}>{children}</ReactGridLayout>;
}
```

Because the `children` prop doesn't change between rerenders, updates to `<MyGrid>` won't result in new renders, improving performance.

### Custom Child Components and Draggable Handles

If you use React Components as grid children, they need to do a few things:

1. Forward refs to an underlying DOM node, and
2. Forward `style` and `className` to that same DOM node.

For example:

```js
const CustomGridItemComponent = React.forwardRef(({style, className, ...props}, ref) => {
  return (
    <div style={{ /* styles */, ...style}} className={className} ref={ref}>
      {/* Some other content */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

The same is true of custom elements as draggable handles using the `draggableHandle` prop. This is so that
the underlying `react-draggable` library can get a reference to the DOM node underneath, manipulate
positioning via `style`, and set classes.
